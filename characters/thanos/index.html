  <h1>Thanos</h1>
  <p>Thanos is the ultimate Villain, and that’s even before he gets his hands on a few Infinity Stones. He punches harder that anyone, crushing Heroes next to him, and even affecting all Location around him. When he KO’s a Hero, they don’t recover and stand back up next turn. No, they’re snapped out of existence! The player then has to bring a new Hero into the game (having those extra Stretch Goal Heroes will come in very handy). If enough Heroes are eliminated, then all is lost. Bringing Thanos down before that will not be easy, as his formidable strength even allows him to recover a lot of his health.</p>
<p>The Threats he places on each Location position all the Children of Thanos as Henchmen to aid him in the final battle. Black Dwarf, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and even Corvus Glaive, each does their part to aid him. He even gets Chitauri to act as the toughest Thugs in the game.</p>
<p>Winning against Thanos will never be easy, so you better have as many Power-Ups to aid you as possible. Even if by some miracle you manage to confront him with no Infinity Stones, the fight will still be arduous. If he has a Gauntlet decked out with 5 Infinity Stones… Well, the odds may be better than 14 million to one. But not by much.</p>
