  <h1>Terrax</h1>
  <p>Terrax the Conqueror has a clear plan: total domination. By KO’ing Heroes and causing Overflows he is able to increase his Domination track until he is finally victorious. And Heroes will have a hard time avoiding being KO’d, as Terrax’s attacks are strong enough to cause earthquakes on the other side of the play area! With his powers of geokinesis, Terrax can create barriers between Locations, forcing Heroes to waste additional Move Actions to remove such barriers before they can proceed. Terrax’s Threats further aid his conquering plans, as they allow him to endanger Civilians and deploy Thugs, increasing his Domination track if he’s able to add enough of them to his Location.</p>
