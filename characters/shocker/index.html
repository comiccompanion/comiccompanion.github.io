  <h1>Shocker</h1>
  <p>You’ll feel Shocker’s electrifying presence way before you see him. With his high voltage discharges, Shocker’s BAMs not only damage but also stun Heroes that are on his or adjacent Locations, putting half of the game area under his influence. Heroes that are stunned treat Special Effects on all their cards as blank and are only able to remove this condition at the end of their turns. To make matters worse, his electric discharges can severely disrupt various Equipment from time to time, effectively removing Equipment cards from the game. Finally, Shocker is a man on a mission to become a respectable Villain, with a list of achievements to get there (such as KO’ing Heroes, Overflowing Locations, Stunning the same Hero twice, etc.). Should he manage to complete all his tasks, he’ll take the game and leave nothing in his wake!</p>
