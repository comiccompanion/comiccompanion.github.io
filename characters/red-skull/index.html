  <h1>Red Skull</h1>
  <p>Red Skull is a cold and calculating Villain. Hydra has a long-term plan and will find many different ways to accomplish it. Red Skull endangers Civilians and uses them to advance his track to ultimate victory. He often offers the Heroes the chance to mitigate their obstacles by taking Crisis tokens, however they should be wary of that path since that can eventually advance the Red Skull’s master plan beyond recovery.</p>
<p>Red Skull’s Threats further push his strategies forward, brainwashing the Heroes into taking Crisis tokens and using subversive tactics to add Civilians to his cause. The Heroes will find dangerous obstacles in the form of elite Hydra troops, and sinister Henchmen like Madame Hydra, Crossbones, and… Bob.</p>
<p>While Red Skull is by no means an easy Villain to beat, he is recommended as the first one players should tackle since his mechanics are fairly straightforward and help players get acquainted with all aspects of the game.</p>
