  <h1>Mysterio</h1>
  <p>Mysterio is all about tricking the Heroes, and as such he turns some the rules of the game upside down. Facing him is to plunge into the mists of illusion, where you can’t attack him even after completing 2 Missions. All of his Threats start the game face down, and the Heroes must spend actions to first uncover them before they can deal with them. Why not just leave them facedown? Well, because hidden among them is the way to break Mysterio’s cloak of illusion. Only once one of those cards is revealed the Heroes are finally able to attack him. Of course, the other facedown Threats are traps of all sorts, such as battle drones that attack you, or hidden Thugs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his Masterplan cards allow Mysterio to bring some of his shattered illusions back online, shuffling the remaining Threat cards and placing them back facedown. And he also can’t resist some fake acts of heroism before a crowd of Civilians to speed up his master plan.</p>
<p>Heroes will need to forget all they know when facing Mysterio. Nothing is quite what it seems…</p>
