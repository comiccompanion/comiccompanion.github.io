  <h1>Old Man Logan</h1>
  <p>Old Man Logan has a very unique progression during the game. He starts with a Retired card in his hand, which gives him 3 Attack tokens, but also prevents him from spending Attack tokens to Attack, as long as that card is faceup in the Storyline. In fact, his whole deck contains no Attack actions, so he must rely on his companions to perform Attacks. Once he retires, his many Tired of Fighting cards allow him to ignore 1 damage on the Villain turn, and also give him an Attack token (which he canâ€™t use wile Retired is faceup on the Storyline). Old Man Logan actually has a card that must start at the bottom of his deck. When My name is Wolverine! is finally played, he gains another 3 Attack tokens and the Retired card is turned facedown, allowing him to finally spend all his accumulated Attack tokens in one epic final stand!</p>
