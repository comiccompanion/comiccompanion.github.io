  <h1>Abomination</h1>
  <p>Fighting the Abomination is a furious and relentless encounter. He starts the game already Under Pressure and vulnerable to damage, accelerating his plan whenever he KO’s a Hero. His attacks come fast and powerful, also discarding all Thugs and Civilians around him. Luckily for the Heroes they may all draw 1 card whenever a Mission is complete. They will need that endurance to go toe-to-toe with Abomination, whose Health is truly legendary. His Master Plan cards all have special effects, allowing him to jump across the play area to attack Heroes, hide underwater to make him harder to attack, push Heroes around, turn Hero cards facedown, and bring back cleared Threats. Clearing the Abomination’s Threats will be vital to defeat him, as they make his attacks even more lethal, block Location effects where he is, heal him, make him harder to damage, and even keep him from being defeated at all!</p>
