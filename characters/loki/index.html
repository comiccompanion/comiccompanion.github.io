  <h1>Loki</h1>
  <p>Loki is the perfect foil to the powerful champions of Asgard. His path to victory is not through direct confrontation, but by unraveling his devious master plan. Of course, he’s not afraid to strike at the Heroes, but he prefers to do so under the cover of illusion and misdirection, hitting them when they least expect.</p>
<p>All Loki does is in order to buy time and empty his deck of Masterplan cards as quickly as possible, before the Heroes can corner and subdue him. He manipulates the Heroes by making them unsure whether to stick together or spread out. While his sorcery can harm lone heroes, the same can be accomplished by sowing discord among Heroes banding together.</p>
<p>The Threats he spreads on the Locations are equally devious, granting him immunity through illusion, retribution through trickery, or simple muscle power in the form of fierce Frost Giants. Bringing down Loki will take strength and smarts in equal measure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/marvel-united/posts/2756365Loki">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/marvel-united/posts/2756365Loki</a> may be a suspicious Hero, but when he sets his mind to it, he can be a formidable one. With a deck filled with Wild Actions, he is very resourceful. When Loki uses his shapeshifting powers, he can redirect damage to him to another Hero or Henchman. As the God of Mischief, he’s able to trick the Villain, overriding their movement and choosing where they go. He can use his Scepter to perform Heroic Actions or recharge his Equipment.</p>
<p>Loki’s Scepter is a useful reminder of his dubious ways, allowing him to make powerful ranged Attacks by adding Thugs to the game.</p>
