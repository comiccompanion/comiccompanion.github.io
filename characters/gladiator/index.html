  <h1>Gladiator</h1>
  <p>As a Hero, Gladiator is a mighty ally. The Heat Beams he projects can be as powerful as the number of cards he has in his hand. The fact that he has Accelerated Healing Factor as a Starting Hand card ensures he keeps his hand filled even if taking a beating. Plus, his invulnerability protects him from Crisis tokens as long as he can keep his hand full.</p>
<p>As a Villain, Gladiator uses his position as Praetor of the Imperial Guard to attack the Heroes across different Locations and stations Imperial Guards as elite Thugs. The fight against Gladiator is a unique one, as he cannot be damaged normally. Instead, once they have completed 2 Missions, Heroes may corner him and challenge him to a Duel. When he BAMs, Gladiator will also challenge a Hero in his Location to a Duel. During a Duel, Gladiator reveals one by one the top 2 cards of his Hero deck (3 if his Location has a Great Confidence Threat). When each card is revealed, the dueling Hero must reveal cards from their hand with Action symbols at the bottom that match the symbols at the bottom of Gladiator’s card. If they can, the duel proceeds to the next card. If they can’t, they lose the duel and Gladiator advances his Duel track. If the Hero is able to reveal cards matching the symbols of all of Gladiator’s revealed cards, they win the duel and advance the Heroes Duel track. The first side to reach the end of their track wins the game!</p>
