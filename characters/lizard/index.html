  <h1>Lizard</h1>
  <p>The Lizard is an extremely elusive Villain. Instead of occupying locations, he only moves on Sewer Tunnels, tokens which are placed between locations. He attacks Heroes and adds Thugs and Civilians in the locations adjacent to his current Sewer token. Heroes are simply unable to attack the Lizard directly. Instead, they must first find a cure for Doctor Connors’ condition. This is done by completing a special Mission. They must spend 2 Heroic Actions in a location with no Thugs to add a Threat token to the Mission card. Once all Missions are complete, they need to corner the Lizard by occupying the locations to either side of his Sewer token, so they can administer the serum and cure him.</p>
<p>Oh, did we mention the Alligators? Yes, Thugs in this game represent Alligators spread by the Lizard, overflowing the sewers and swarming the streets. Every location has an Alligator Threat card that can never be cleared. Whenever a BAM! is triggered, all Thug-Alligators attack the Heroes in their locations. It’s a snappin’-fun time!</p>
