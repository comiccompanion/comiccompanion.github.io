  <h1>Demogoblin</h1>
  <p>Demogoblin and Doppelganger are Carnage’s “adopted children”, and so they act together as a Villain duo. The Heroes will need to contend with both of them throughout the game, as they rely on each other to pose a serious threat to the Heroes.</p>
<p>Using a single Master Plan deck, the cards activate both Villains, moving each one independently and adding Thugs and Civilians sometimes around Demogoblin and sometimes around Doppelganger. When they BAM, Doppelganger attacks a Hero in his Location, while Demogoblin attacks Heroes all around him. In his hellish rampage Demogoblin also discards all Thugs and Civilians in his Location. Discarded Thugs are placed in the Rescue Civilians Missions and discarded Civilians are placed in the Defeat Thugs Mission. This creates a race with the Heroes, since when one of these Missions is completed, they must check whether it has more of the tokens that belong there or more of the wrong tokens that were placed there by Demogoblin. If it’s the latter, that mission is Lost. If Heroes lose both of them, the whole game is lost!</p>
<p>Using their Dark Empathy Threats, Demogoblin and Doppelganger can use Thugs and Civilians to attack the Heroes. Magic Anomalies in half of the Locations force Heroes who end their turn there to discard their hand, drawing back one less card. Defeating one of the Villains does not eliminate them, the Heroes will need to bring both of them down before they can emerge victorious.</p>
