  <h1>Morbius</h1>
  <p>As a Hero, Morbius, the living vampire, uses his vast arsenal of vampiric powers for good. The power of blood allows him to discard cards to perform extra Actions. Heâ€™s able to recover from that by giving in to his hunger, defeating a Thug or discarding a Civilian (chomp!) to draw a card. He may also use his Mesmer Gaze to stun a Villain or Henchman, cancelling their BAM!</p>
<p>As a Villain, Morbius surrenders to his vampiric nature and starts assembling his army of vampires. Morbius flies around, hunting the Heroes and infecting them with Crisis tokens. Not only does accumulating Crisis tokens make Heroes more vulnerable to his attacks, but they lose the game if they accumulate too many. Using his Mesmer Gaze, Morbius can force heroes to play their next card randomly, unless they can protect themselves with enough Heroic Actions. Once Morbius is Under Pressure, his hunger makes him turn Civilians into Thugs, recovering Health in the process. His Threats turn these mobs of Thugs into pseudo-vampires, attacking the Heroes and giving them further Crisis tokens.</p>
