  <h1>Spider Punk</h1>
  <p>Hobie doesn’t play by anybody’s rules but his own. Always ready to fight the power, he can move to any Location to attack a Henchman or Villain. The more Civilians are put in danger, the more violent Spider-Punk gets, dealing out vicious attacks with his Angry Heart, equal to the number of endangered Civilians in his Location. He can even rally the masses into an anarchic uprising, using Civilians in several Locations to attack his enemies. And when all else fails, he may just stun the enemy with 15,000 Watts of Punk Rock, from an army of amps set to 11!</p>
<p>Equipped with his Web-Shooters, Spider-Punk can more easily move around or pull Thugs or Civilians toward him.</p>
