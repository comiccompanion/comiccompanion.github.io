  <h1>Black Dwarf</h1>
  <p>Black Dwarf is a brute with a simple plan: crush the Heroes. His master plan is accelerated each time he KO’s a Hero, and so that’s what he does single-mindedly. Swinging his axe, he’s able to hit heroes not only in his Location, but all around him as well. He also has a healing factor that makes it even tougher for the Heroes to take him out.</p>
<p>Most of his Threats give him boosts as long as they’re not cleared, soaking damage he would receive or extending the range of his attacks. They also allow him to charge against all Heroes the moment he enters a Location.</p>
<p>Black Dwarf is a simple opponent, but maybe the hardest of the Children of Thanos to defeat.</p>
