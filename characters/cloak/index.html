  <h1>Cloak</h1>
  <p>With his Darkforce Teleportation starting hand card, Cloak is able to Move anywhere, taking Dagger with him, as long as they are both in the same Location. His bond with Dagger also allows her to heal herself if she stays with him for a while. By using Darkforce Channeling, Cloak absorbs a Henchman in his Location into his darkness, taking them out of play along with him. On his next turn, they both return to any Location without a Threat, dealing 2 damage against the Henchman.</p>
<p>Note: As these Stretch Goals are a last-minute addition due to the unprecedented success of the campaign, we don’t yet have these characters sculpted. We are working on it and we’ll update you as soon as they are approved.</p>
