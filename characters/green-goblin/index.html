  <h1>Green Goblin</h1>
  <p>Do not be lulled into a false sense of security by the fact that the fight against Green Goblin starts with no Threats in play. This Villain’s master plan is all about plunging New York into utter chaos, and so he’ll be constantly adding new Threats to the different Locations. And even worse, after a Threat is cleared, it may still be brought back into play! If the whole city is dominated by Threats, the Heroes have truly lost.</p>
<p>As the fight goes on, the Green Goblin makes himself stronger and stronger by enhancing his secret formula. Taking him out will not be easy, as he tends to use Civilians as human shields. His Threats also contain a sinister set of Henchmen: Electro, Kraven, and the Lizard.</p>
<p>Keep your spider-senses alert and try not to be too distracted by the Threats thrown at you, and you may just be able to take out the Green Goblin.</p>
