  <h1></h1>
  <p>As a Hero, U.S.Agent is a ruthless one. He shows no mercy to Civilians, discarding them in order to perform extra attacks. He will even use Thugs or Civilians as protection, discarding them to avoid damage. Not one to be out upstaged, U.S.Agent can move to the next location with any other Heroes to fight there.</p>
<p>U.S.Agent can use his Shield to either attack an adjacent location or defend his location. U.S.Agent’s cards even allow him to attack while recharging his Shield equipment.</p>
<p>U.S.Agent is a Villain who still thinks he’s a Hero. Instead of using a Master Plan deck like other Villains, he plays his Hero cards in the Storyline, moving and attacking in various ways according to the symbols at the bottom of those cards, and even using the Special Effects on his cards to attack and use Civilians and Thugs to his advantage. He even makes use of the U.S.Agent&rsquo;s Shield Equipment card, making him almost invulnerable unless the Heroes use Heroic Actions to turn it facedown. U.S.Agent will keep attacking the Heroes, focusing on the weakest, using the justice system and government agents as Threats to flood the locations with Thugs and endangered Civilians, until his “Heroic Plan” is complete or he is stopped for good.</p>
