  <h1>Brotherhood of Mutants</h1>
  <p>From the very start of the campaign, we already added to every pledge, whether Mutant or Apocalypse, a very special team of Kickstarter Exclusive Villains: Pyro, Blob, and Toad. These bad guys are not exactly your normal Marvel United Villains. In fact, all of them are already part of the X-Men core box as Henchmen cards to Magneto or Mystique. Each on their own is not exactly what you would call a Super Villain, but united as the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, they can pose a very serious threat. And this is how they are added to the game: a team of Villains that are always used together and face the Heroes as a unified team.</p>
<p>The trio starts scattered all over the play area. Their Master Plan cards will usually activate two of them at a time, moving them around, adding Civilians and Thugs to each Location, and triggering their BAM. A few cards even activate all three of them! The Heroes will have to take them down one by one, eliminating them all before their Master Plan is finished (and the plan gets accelerated each time there’s an Overflow or a Hero is KO’d). Now let’s see what each of them brings to the Brotherhood team:</p>
<p>Toad
Blob
Pyro</p>
