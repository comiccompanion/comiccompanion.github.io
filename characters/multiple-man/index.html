  <h1>Multiple Man</h1>
  <p>Multiple Man is truly all over the place. A starting hand card gives him the kinetic duplication ability, which means every turn he can place one of his Dupe tokens in his Location. Dupe tokens are treated as Civilian tokens for all game purposes, occupying one of those slots in the Location. Multiple Man can perform Heroic and Attack actions as if he were in the same Location as any of his Dupe tokens. He can also spread his Dupes around, moving them to adjacent Locations. He can choose to absorb back Dupes in his Location, drawing extra cards into his hand, or even call upon his army of Dupes to perform Heroic or Attack actions where they are before getting removed.</p>
