  <h1>Nova (Frankie Raye)</h1>
  <p>Some Villains just want to see the universe burn. Nova spreads her cosmic fire across the galaxy, adding Crisis tokens to the Locations via her BAMs, Master Plan cards, and Overflows. Once a Location has 3 Crisis tokens, its End of Turn effect is lost, and the fire starts to spread to adjacent Locations! Of course, Heroes ending their turn on Locations with Crisis tokens suffer damage from the flames. Nova has no Threat cards, so Heroes should take advantage of the Locationsâ€™ End of Turn effects as much as possible before they go up in flames!</p>
<p>While any trace of purple has been consumed by the fire of her game piece, Nova is indeed an Anti-Hero. As a Hero, she tries to use her powerful flames for good (though playing with fire is always a dangerous proposition). Her Pyrokinesis Starting Hand card allows her to attack adjacent Locations, though this places dangerous Crisis tokens on them. She may also discard a card to generate a devastating Nova Flame, damaging everything around her.</p>
