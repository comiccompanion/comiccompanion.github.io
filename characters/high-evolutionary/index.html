  <h1>High Evolutionary</h1>
  <p>The High Evolutionary plays quite differently from any other encounter. His Master Plan cards all have Threats on their backs, with half of them starting as his deck and the other half being placed as Threat cards on the locations. These Threats are his genetic manipulations, which force Heroes to discard random cards from their hand. When cleared, these cards are flipped and added to the bottom of the Master Plan deck. The most dangerous of them being his De-Evolution, which forces Heroes around the Evolutionary to discard all cards with Special Effects from their hands. All the while, the Evolution track advances for each overflowing token, counting down to the Heroes’ defeat.</p>
<p>The High Evolutionary does have one Henchman, Jackal, who moves around attacking Heroes and evades all attacks. Jackal does have a larger part to play in this plot, but this could be regarded as a SPOILER for this game, so if you want to preserve a surprising twist, don’t read on.</p>
<p>Once 3 Missions are complete (which may happen sooner than you think, since overflowing tokens are placed directly on Missions), the High Evolutionary can be damaged, and also Jackal’s Threat card is flipped over, revealing him to be the true villain of this story! The Jackal starts chasing the High Evolutionary, attacking not only the Heroes, but the Evolutionary himself. To win the game, the Heroes must defeat the Jackal before he manages to eliminate the High Evolutionary!</p>
