  <h1>Vulcan</h1>
  <p>Vulcan is a Villain who is out to subjugate the Heroes, intimidating them so they don’t use their superpowers, or taking them out if they step out of line. When he attacks, it is just about as devastating as it gets. First, he deals damage to all Heroes in his Locations as well as both adjacent ones. Then, every Hero who played a card with a Special effect since the last Villain turn must discard a card. As one would imagine, Heroes will be KO’d left and right, and that’s just what Vulcan wants, as he wins the game once he’s dealt out enough KO tokens.</p>
<p>As Emperor of the Shi’ar, Vulcan may be protected by his Thugs, making it impossible to hit him. He may also manipulate the energy used by the Heroes, healing himself whenever they play a card with a Special Effect. Vulcan’s Threats also help him suppress the Heroes’ power, hurting anybody who attacks him, or cancelling their Special Effects. His wife, Deathbird, acts as his Henchman, attacking Heroes in multiple Locations. And their never-ending love can bring her back into play if she’s defeated!</p>
