  <h1>Kate Bishop</h1>
  <p>Kate Bishop is unparalleled with a bow and arrow, being able to split her shots across various locations. Clever in gaining the support of the people, she has extra Heroic Actions, gaining further Heroic tokens if she uses them to rescue Civilians. She may also get another Hero to drive her around while she shoots, moving that Hero with her and performing free Attacks in each location they enter. Resourceful, she may gain Wild tokens or recharge for free one of the Trick Arrows she always carries around.</p>
<p>Kateâ€™s quiver is full of Trick Arrows. In fact, she must choose only 3 of the 4 Equipment cards available to her to use in any game. Explosive Arrows damage multiple targets in an adjacent location, Wire Arrows allow her to Move and perform a Heroic Action, Pym Particle Arrows keep a Henchman from using their BAM!, and Smoke Bomb Arrows protect all Heroes in an adjacent location.</p>

<p>Most of the master resins have already been approved for the characters. We&rsquo;d like to point out one tweak that&rsquo;s been made since the campaign. When we announced the Civil War expansion, some backers pointed out that the position of Kate Bishop&rsquo;s quiver on her back was wrong, as the arrows were sticking out of her left shoulder and she draws with her right hand. We have since edited the piece so that the quiver is now in the right position. Thanks for the heads up!</p>
