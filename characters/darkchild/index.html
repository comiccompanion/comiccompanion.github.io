  <h1>Darkchild</h1>
  <p>As a Hero, Darkchild is in full control of her magic powers. She uses sorcery to perform extra action or heal Heroes, her Stepping Discs allow her to move to any location, and she can even time travel to swap cards with the Storyline. She has the constant ability to open a portal to Limbo, moving to a card outside the play area, and taking other Heroes with her. Moving to Limbo does cost a Hero any Action tokens they may have, if they start their turn there, and Heroes other than Darkchild take damage if they end their turn there. However, it can be a good place to hide from the Villain, and from Limbo Heroes can move to any location.</p>
<p>Soulword cards allow Darkchild to deal extra damage when attacking Villains or Henchmen. With the Soulsword Equipment she can be sure to draw those cards whenever she needs them.</p>
<p>As a Villain, Darkchild is trying to bring Limbo closer to our existence. Many of her effects, such as Overflow and attacks, add Crisis tokens to the Limbo card. If that card ever fills with 12 tokens, literally all hell breaks loose, and she wins. When a Hero is KOâ€™d, they are sent to the Limbo card, with all the negative effects explained before. However, paying this high price may be needed, as Heroes can clear Crisis tokens there with considerable effort.</p>
<p>With her Master Plan cards, Darkchild can not only slaughter Heroes with her Soulsword, but also add extra Crisis tokens to Limbo the more she manages to send Heroes to that dark dimension. To make things worse, the road to hell is a two-way street, so she fills the locations with her Limbo Demon Henchmen, eager to whack Heroes right to Limbo.</p>
