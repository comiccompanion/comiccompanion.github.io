  <h1>Sabretooth</h1>
  <p>Sabretooth is a natural hunter. He starts the game with a specific Hero as his target, and hunts them down relentlessly, with truly vicious attacks, until they are KO’d. Then he just sets his sights on the next Hero and does it all over again. He keeps on hunting one Hero after the next, until he’s taken them all down, emerging victorious.</p>
<p>His regenerative factor makes him very hard to take out, recovering Health every turn once that card is in the Storyline. His Threats set him on a killing spree, wiping out swathes of Civilians, and giving the Hunted Hero no place to hide as they are constantly being ambushed.</p>
