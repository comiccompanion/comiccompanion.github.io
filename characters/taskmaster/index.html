  <h1>Taskmaster</h1>
  <p>Taskmaster is a devious Villain, setting traps all over the place and hiding from the Heroes until his master plan is complete. He lays Crisis tokens all over the game, which the Heroes need to deal with before they have any chance of catching him and taking him down. Heroes need to empty a Location before they can disarm the traps there, which makes the job of crisis control extremely tricky. Taskmaster often employs his copycat abilities, using the Heroes’ actions to perform his evil deeds.</p>
<p>The Threats he sets on Locations mostly fills them with all sorts of traps that slow down the Heroes and make it much harder for them to rescue Civilians.</p>
<p>It is recommended that new players take on the Taskmaster last. Since he adds a bit more complexity to the game, it’s better if players are very familiar with the rules before tackling him.</p>
