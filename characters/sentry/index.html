  <h1>Sentry</h1>
  <p>The Sentry is a Hero imbued with so much power to the point of making him unstable. The more he unleashes his power, the more he is drawn by the Dark Entity that seeks him. All of his Special Effect cards require him to place a number of Crisis tokens on his Dark Entity special card. His Starting Hand card makes him almost invulnerable by allowing him to draw cards whenever he’s about to take damage (adding the same number of Crisis tokens to the Dark Entity card). Even altruistic actions, like allowing another Hero to perform 2 Actions of their choice, come with their toll. His uncontrolled power gives him 1, 2, or even 3 Wild Actions, placing the same number of Crisis tokens on the Dark Entity card.</p>
<p>Whenever the Dark Entity card accumulates 3 Crisis tokens, he must draw a card from his The Void deck, resolving a negative effect that represents him being overwhelmed by The Void in his descent into darkness. This may range from him feeling hollow and losing Move Actions, all the way to a violent outburst that may very well KO another Hero!</p>
<p>As a Villain, the Sentry has been fully consumed by The Void! Serving The Void, he turns Civilians into his Dark Army, perverting them into Thugs through his Overflow effect and some of his Master plan cards and using them to attack the Heroes. While his attacks deal unpreventable damage to all Heroes, no matter where they are, The Void himself can only be damaged if the Heroes first Stun him by spending 2 Heroic Actions in his Locations.</p>
<p>The Void’s molecular manipulation can influence Heroes, giving them Crisis tokens through Master Plan or Crisis cards. This makes them susceptible to his tendril strikes, suffering damage or turning their Storyline cards facedown. Some of The Void’s Master Plans give him the alertness to avoid attacks, while some of his Threats protect him from all damage, even if stunned. The Threats on a couple of Locations, however, give him a moment of doubt, cancelling his BAM when he arrived there. These respites are short-lived, though, as these Threats are automatically complete the second time he ends there.</p>
