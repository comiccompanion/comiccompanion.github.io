  <h1>Rhino</h1>
  <p>Rhino is an unstoppable juggernaut. He’s not much of a mastermind, so his plan is simple: charge at the Heroes again and again, knocking them around like ragdolls until his Masterplan is done. His BAM! effect deals damage to Heroes according to how much he moved that turn. If he charges across the whole play area, he can one-shot any Hero. So, they have a tough choice to make: stand close to Rhino, increasing their chance of being hit, or run from him, increasing the damage they take if he does charge all the way to them. And Rhino’s attacks even bumps the heroes all the way to the next Location!</p>
<p>His Threats and KO effect stuns Heroes, forcing them to play their next card facedown, so all they can do is rely on the card played by the previous Hero.</p>
<p>Heroes will need to be quick on their feet and play smartly if they hope to avoid getting splattered by this beast of a Villain.</p>
