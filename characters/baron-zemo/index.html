  <h1>Baron Zemo</h1>
  <p>Baron Zemo has a devious plan to defeat the Heroes: trick people into believing his Masters of Evil band of villains is actually a superhero group called the Thunderbolts, all the while breaking the cooperation between the real Heroes.</p>
<p>Using his BAM! effect, or by filling the Locations with Civilians and Thugs, Baron Zemo disrupts a Hero’s ability to cooperate by giving them Crisis tokens. On their turn, a Hero with such tokens must place them on the card they played, hiding action symbols which then become useless for the next Hero.</p>
<p>With his Masterplan cards he’s able to assume the mantle of Citizen V, getting Civilians to follow him so Heroes can’t complete their Mission. He can also summon the Masters of Evil to flood a Location with Thugs to attack the Heroes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his Threat cards place the members of the Thunderbolts on each Location. Beetle kidnaps Civilians, Fixer relocates Thugs, while Goliath, Moonstone, and Screaming Mimi damage the Heroes in various ways. Heroes cannot attack them before first uncovering the Masters of Evil plot (a Threat on its own). Once that’s done, they can either fight those Henchmen directly, or use a set number of Heroic Actions in a single turn to expose them and take them out.</p>
