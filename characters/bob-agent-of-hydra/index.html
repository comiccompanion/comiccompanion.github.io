  <h1>Bob, Agent of Hydra</h1>
  <p>If Deadpool is OP (and he probably is), then Bob is certainly nerfed (which I guess means they make for a balanced duo). As a Hero, Bob… isn’t much of a Hero. Most of the time he seems to be helping the Villain more than his fellow Heroes, as anything he does right tends to come with a side effect. He gains a Wild token; other Heroes must discard an Action token. He gains TWO Wild tokens; there goes a Master Plan card being played facedown. He throws a couple extra Attack tokens to a teammate or finds a way to straight up add a couple tokens to a Mission card; somehow that accelerates the next Villain turn. Sometimes he’s accidentally heroic, clearing a Threat with no effort at all; well, of course he immediately gets knocked out. Sometimes he can’t even help it, as one of his cards has a black special effect that MUST be performed when the card is played, forcing Bob to simply run away if the Villain shows up around him.</p>
<p>Now, as a Villain, Bob… isn’t much of a Villain either. In fact, he doesn’t so much have a Master Plan as he has a Retirement Plan. All he’s trying to do is run the clock and increase his savings enough that he can retire to a tropical paradise somewhere. Bob is in no rush to face the Heroes, so he’s never Under Pressure, and can only be damaged once all 3 Missions have been completed. Bob tries to avoid the Heroes as much as possible, as his savings increase if he BAMs with no Heroes around him but decrease if he’s cornered. His Retirement Plan cards throw Thugs, Civilians, and Henchmen under the bus in order to increase Bob’s savings by any means necessary.</p>
<p>But don’t think you’re safe just because Bob has no interest in fighting the Heroes. Bob works for powerful villains, and they are scattered around all Locations as “Henchmen” (do not call them that to their faces). Kingpin uses Thugs to attack Heroes. Green Goblin forces you to complete the Rescue Civilians mission before he can be attacked. M.O.D.O.K. drains the Heroes by turning their last played card facedown. Taskmaster can’t be damaged until the Clear Threats mission has been completed and he neutralizes Location effects. Red Skull assaults the Heroes until the Defeat Thugs mission has been completed. And finally, Tiger Shark totally chews on a Hero.</p>
