  <h1>Silver Surfer (Herald)</h1>
  <p>But that’s not all! Many MORE backers pointed out it was a shame they couldn’t face Silver Surfer in his original role: a Herald of Galactus. After even more deliberation with the design team, we decided to add 3 new cards to The Coming of Galactus expansion, creating an optional module where players can substitute one of the four regular Heralds for the Silver Surfer, both in the game against Galactus and in the Heralds of Galactus mode!</p>
<p>Galactus: Players choose one of the Heralds and remove their Stop Galactus Mission card and Threat card from the game, substituting them for the new Silver Surfer ones. Silver Surfer then acts as one of Galactus’ Henchmen, dealing powerful attacks against the Heroes and always surfing away as far as possible so the next Hero can’t attack him.</p>
<p>Heralds of Galactus: Players remove one of the Heralds and use Silver Surfer instead. They use one of the generic Herald tokens to identify Silver Surfer on the dashboard. Since all that is needed from a Villain to be used as a Herald is their BAM effect, Silver Surfer has a special card filling in for a Villain Dashboard. He is a very elusive Herald, striking hard and immediately zipping away to the opposite side of the play area so the next Hero must chase him down. Silver Surfer is a conflicted Herald, however, and Heroes can also use Heroic Actions to defeat him, convincing him to leave Galactus’ service.</p>
