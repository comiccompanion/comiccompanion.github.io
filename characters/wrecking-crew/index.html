  <h1>Wrecking Crew</h1>
  <p>The quartet starts all together in the same Location. Most of their Master Plan cards will activate two of them at a time, moving them around, triggering their BAMs, and adding Civilians and Thugs to their Locations. The other cards either activate all of them or trigger various special effects. Their master plan isn’t much more complex than just stealing all the loot they can. KO’ing Heroes and causing Overflows increases their Loot track. All of the Threats are bank robberies, which the Heroes must stop one by one by spending Moves, Attacks, and Heroic Actions, before they can finally take on the Wrecking Crew directly (there are no other Missions in this game). However, one of the Master Plan cards might completely change the Villains’ plan mid-game, shifting their strategies!</p>
<p>Now let’s see what each member of this crew brings to the fight.</p>
<p>Wrecker is the leader of the crew, armed with his magical crowbar. The Crowbar token, which Wrecker carries with him wherever he goes, is a key element in the Wrecking Crew’s gameplan. It empowers the other members, serves as a rallying point, and can bring back cleared Threats. Wrecker is the toughest of the bunch, hitting hard with his crowbar, and flooding his location with Thugs and Civilians.</p>
<p>Thunderball swings his ball and chain with surprising strength, being able to hit Heroes in adjacent locations. If Wrecker’s magic Crowbar is nearby, his attack deals even more damage. He also brings additional Thugs to his aid.</p>
<p>Piledriver is fast and his oversized fists hit like a ton of bricks, specially if Wrecker’s Crowbar in nearby. He also endangers Civilians in his location.</p>
<p>Bulldozer is almost as tough as Wrecker. He chases the next Hero, wherever they may be, and charges headlong into them, dealing extra damage if the magic Crowbar is nearby to empower him.</p>
