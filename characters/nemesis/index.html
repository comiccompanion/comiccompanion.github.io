  <h1>Nemesis</h1>
  <p>The son of Apocalypse, Nemesis enforces his father’s dark rule by accumulating Crisis tokens until he wins the game. He gains these tokens by KO’ing Heroes and causing Overflows. His attacks affect Heroes over a large area, not only damaging them but also healing Nemesis. Being KO’d by Nemesis may also break a Hero’s spirit, causing them to permanently lose a card. Nemesis&rsquo; crystalline armor prevents Heroes from dealing more than 3 damage to him per turn, plus, half of his Threats further reinforce him, so he’s able to ignore some damage. He may also do some blood harvesting when he arrives at some locations, discarding Civilians around him to gain even more Crisis tokens. Sabretooth acts as his reluctant Henchman, moving around and attacking Heroes, though they may be able to reason with him if they have enough Heroic symbols on their hand.</p>
