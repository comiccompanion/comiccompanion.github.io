  <h1>Purple Man</h1>
  <p>Purple Man is a despicable Villain, using his mind control powers to bend others to his will. His BAMs can force nearby Heroes to play their card randomly and controls them so they can’t attack him. Other nearby Heroes can try to shake off his mind control by revealing a great number of Heroic symbols on their cards or using their own telepathic powers. Killgrave’s Master Plan cards can subjugate the crowds, turning Civilians into Thugs, then having them attack the Heroes. His Threats allow him to use innocent bystanders as protection, using Civilians to keep the Heroes from attacking him. They also accelerate his recovery, resetting his Health while they remain in play.</p>
