  <h1>Knull</h1>
  <p>Knull is an eldritch god of terrifying power, the creator of the symbiotes. He’s so imposing that players can use up to 6 Heroes to fight him! Even the turn sequence is different when playing against Knull, with 2 Heroes playing their cards simultaneously every Hero turn and benefitting from the symbols on each other’s cards. They’ll need all the help they can get, as Knull wields the Necrosword, making all his damage unpreventable by special effects (and his attacks target whole swathes of Heroes at a time). When a Hero is KO’d, they are turned into a Symbiote Henchman, with their Threat card being added to the game, and the player bringing a new Hero into the game. When Knull BAMs, the Symbiote Henchmen use their remaining Hero cards to determine their actions, performing different attacks, adding Civilians, or healing, according to the symbols on their drawn card. If five Heroes are turned into Symbiote Henchmen, the players lose.</p>
<p>All of Knull’s Master Plan cards have special effects, adding Civilians or Thugs across multiple locations, healing Knull, nullifying special effects of damaged Heroes, or bringing back cleared Threats. Speaking of Threats, before Knull starts turning Heroes into Symbiote Henchmen, he’s already aided by some mighty creatures capable of dealing massive unpreventable damage: an army of Symbiote Dragons and the terrifying Venom T-Rex!</p>
