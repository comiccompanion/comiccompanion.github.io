  <h1>Maestro</h1>
  <p>Maestro is an evil version of the Hulk from an alternate reality, and he’s out to take down the Heroes one by one. If it can be believed, he’s an even stronger version of the Hulk, gaining more Health with every Overflow effect and also whenever he KO’s a Hero. And KO Heroes he does, as each of his attacks are almost guaranteed to take out any Hero with a single punch. On top of all this, Maestro is able to ignore 2 damage every turn, making him virtually untouchable. The only way to neutralize him is to bring his old sidekick Rick Jones (represented by a special token) in his Location. Heroes may bring Rick Jones with them when they move, or use Heroic Actions to move him around.</p>
<p>Maestro is aided by a full pack of his Dogs of War Henchmen, scattered across all Locations. These vicious hounds attack the Heroes relentlessly, and if they are taken out, Maestro can use his Master Plan cards to unleash even more of them on the Heroes!</p>
