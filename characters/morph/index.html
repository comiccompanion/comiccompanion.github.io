  <h1>Morph</h1>
  <p>Morph is a mutant who has a hard time taking things seriously. His ability to change shape makes him incredibly resourceful, giving him an inordinate number of Wild actions, which his teammates will certainly also appreciate. He can make the most of the previously played Hero card by adapting his shape to perform any Action needed. Meanwhile, an aggressive shape can deal enough damage to knock the Villain away, or a defensive shape can help him avoid damage. Morphâ€™s shape-shifting form makes him virtually indestructible, allowing him to recover quickly. He also has a very easy time evading any enemy trying to chase him down.</p>
