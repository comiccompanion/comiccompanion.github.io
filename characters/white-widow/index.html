  <h1>White Widow</h1>
  <p>While Yelena Belova has put her days at the Red Room Academy behind her, she remains a master spy capable of infiltrating any organization and thwarting their plans. If she encounters the Villain, she can reveal the top 2 cards of the Master Plan, putting one at the bottom of the deck or removing it from the game entirely! When subterfuge fails, she’s a master fighter capable of using Thugs as meat shields to take damage directed at her.</p>
<p>Yelena is equipped with the standard Black Widow arsenal. The Battle Batons can defeat an extra Thug when they are attacked, and the Widow’s Bite gauntlets can stun a Henchmen, cancelling their BAM! Effect. White Widow’s cards also allow her to recharge her Widow’s Bite for free.</p>
<p>As a Villain, White Widow goes around injecting Heroes with the Deathless Frenzy Serum. When a Hero is given Crisis tokens, they are forced to always consider one of their available Move, Heroic, or Wild symbols as an Attack symbol, turning them into single-minded weapons of destruction. If she’s able to administer enough of the serum, she achieves her plan and wins the game.</p>
<p>Yelena’s strategies are devious. She can interrogate all Heroes in her vicinity, forcing them to reveal their next card in advance and constraining them to play it. She may also use her paralyzing venom to force them to discard cards with Move actions. Her Threats activate the Widow Network, to fill locations with powerful Thugs, or she can disappear among Civilians, making her impossible to attack.</p>
