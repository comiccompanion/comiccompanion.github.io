  <h1>Iron Spider</h1>
  <p>Even as Iron Spider, Peter Parker is still burdened by Great Power (extra Attacks that give him Heroic tokens for Thugs defeated) and Great Responsibility (extra Heroic Actions that give him Attack tokens for Civilians rescued). His Starting Hand Spider-Sense enables him to swing away whenever a Villain reaches his location. As the weight of the Civil War increases, he may even announce to the world “My name is Peter Parker, and I’ve been Spider-Man since I was fifteen years old.” gaining a Wild token and getting rid of any Crisis or Exposed tokens (if playing with the Secret Identity Challenge from the Enter the Spider-Verse expansion).</p>
<p>The Iron Spider Suit gives Peter valuable Equipment. Besides the usual Web-Shooters which allows him to move or pull Thugs or Civilians, his mechanical spider arms (also called Waldoes) give him additional Attack or Heroic Actions.</p>
