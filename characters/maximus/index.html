  <h1>Maximus</h1>
  <p>Maximus is a Villain with a chip on his shoulder and powerful psionic powers. To execute his schemes of ascension to power he manipulates the Heroes, compromising their teamwork. Whenever he BAMs, Heroes in Locations close to him must reveal a random card from their hands, being forced to perform tasks depending on the symbols on their card, running away from Maximus, adding Civilians or Thugs to their location, accelerating the Master Plan, or even attacking each other!</p>
<p>To aid him in his plans for domination, Maximus has allied himself with the League of Evil Inhumans, a group of criminal Henchmen that will make the Heroesâ€™ lives even harder. Timberius adds Civilians to his location and uses them to slow down Heroes, Aireo moves Heroes to the opposite side of the play area, Nebulo is as hard to attack as you would expect a shadow to be, Stallior is an expert fighter, Leonus requires extra agility in order to be engaged in battle, and Falcona commands the Thugs to attack Heroes over multiple locations.</p>
