  <h1>Iron Lad</h1>
  <p>When he started the Young Avengers, Nathaniel Richards took on an identity inspired by Iron Man. However, Iron Lad is so much more than a young Iron Man. While his armor is equipped with long range concussive bolts and focused energy blasts, his nature as a young Kang the Conqueror is evident by his mastery over time. He can fly around on his Time-Ship, performing any action he wants, or time travel by swapping his cards in the Storyline. Potentially game-changing is his ability to flip cards in the Storyline, faceup or facedown, either aiding his teammates in regaining lost abilities, or shutting down dangerous effects by his enemies.</p>
<p>Iron Ladâ€™s Neurokinetic Armor equipment can be devastating if used wisely. It can protect him from any amount of damage, turning that into a barrage of attacks he can perform.</p>
