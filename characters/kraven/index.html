  <h1>Kraven</h1>
  <p>Kraven is a master hunter, and he’s on the hunt for Heroes. He sets his targets by giving them Crisis tokens and then pursues them mercilessly. Heroes marked this way always suffer damage whenever he attacks.</p>
<p>KO’ing them allows him to play extra Masterplan cards, but more than that, if he ever manages to KO all Heroes at the same time, his hunt is complete, and the Heroes lose.</p>
<p>With his Threat cards he makes the play area even more deadly to Heroes, laying down traps to incapacitate them, as well as decoys to keep him safe.</p>
<p>His plan is simple, but deadly. If all the Villain cares is taking you down, do you run and hide, or do you take him head-on?</p>
