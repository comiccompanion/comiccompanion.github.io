  <h1>Deadpool</h1>
  <p>Thanks to his ridiculous regenerative healing factor, Deadpool is nigh-unkillable. A starting hand card allows him to draw a card after any Villain turn where he’s damaged. He just fights through the pain, ignoring damage and getting extra Attack tokens. He may even be able to shrug off any special effects of a Master Plan card. Oftentimes he can be quite unpredictable, gaining a Wild token, but being forced to play his next card randomly. But when he decides to put maximum effort in it, he can blow a sizeable hole into any enemy. And of course, Deadpool can’t resist breaking the fourth wall from time to time. He can reach out and pick a couple cards from the Deadpool Challenge deck (he doesn’t care if you’re actually using that Challenge or not) and choose one to execute.</p>
<p>As a Villain, Deadpool is a totally unique challenge. For one, he simply cannot be defeated. Yep, nothing you can do. You may blow him up, chop him to pieces, or throw him into the sun, but he’ll always be there cracking another sly remark. You better resign yourself do just doing your best until he finally gets bored of killing you and walks away. Tally up some points for rescuing Civilians, defeating Thugs, and clearing Threats. Deduct some points for being KO’d and see how far you can rank on the scoreboard!</p>
<p>As one would expect, when fighting Deadpool the wall between the game and reality becomes pretty thin, with plenty of effects that depend as much on the player as on the Hero they control. Get ready to yell when taking damage, or to avoid a bathroom break, lest Deadpool take you out. And Deadpool is more than ready to kill the entire Marvel Universe, as KO’d Heroes must have their pieces ground to a fine powder (or just removed from the game) and replaced by new ones.</p>
