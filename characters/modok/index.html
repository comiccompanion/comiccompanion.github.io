  <h1>Modok</h1>
  <p>M.O.D.O.K. is a supreme strategist with psionic abilities, which makes him a formidable foe. He’s not so concerned with attacking the Heroes’ bodies, but to probe their minds until they can no longer stand against him. His attacks and other stratagems cause the players to flip down their cards on the Storyline, one by one. If they’re ever all down, all is lost.</p>
<p>Besides employing his Technopathy and Psionic powers, his Threats also place dangerous Henchmen in the Locations. Spot and the Chameleon take advantage of the actions performed by the heroes to flip their cards or attack them directly, while the Living Laser can do either depending on where the heroes are.</p>
<p>Heroes will really need to rethink their usual strategies against this unusual Villain, or they risk losing their heads.</p>
