  <h1>Mole Man</h1>
  <p>Mole Man has launched his plan of revenge and domination against the surface world by unleashing his hordes of Moloids and other monsters. His BAM! effect, Overflow effect, and also a couple of Moloids Threat cards fill the Civilian/Thug slots of the locations with Crisis tokens, representing the armies of the underground realm taking over the surface. These spread from location to location, making Overflows harder and harder to avoid, until the Heroes lose the game!</p>
<p>Mole Man himself may not seem like a very intimidating foe (though he can pull a trick or two with that stave of his), but it is his monstrous Henchman that will really threaten the Heroes. These giants attack the heroes in various deadly ways, and they are further empowered by Mole Manâ€™s Master Plan cards. Defeating them discards Crisis tokens, though Mole Man may be able to bring them back into play.</p>
