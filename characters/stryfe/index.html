  <h1>Stryfe</h1>
  <p>In order to fulfill his Master Plan, Stryfe relies on his Dark Riders to dominate the galaxy. He is constantly adding Thugs to the Locations with his BAMs, and if they Overflow, all Civilians there are turned into Thugs. Heroes will have a hard time taking them out, as the first Dark Rider they attack each turn always requires 2 Attacks to be defeated. If all Locations are dominated by these Thugs, everything is lost.</p>
<p>Stryfe uses his psionic powers to neutralize the Heroesâ€™ special effects, and when he unleashes his telekinetic attacks they are utterly devastating to those Heroes unfortunate enough to be caught next to him. Positioning forcefields around the Locations, Stryfe makes himself almost untouchable until the Heroes weaken these defenses. However, the Heroes will be weakened themselves by the spread of the Legacy Virus, which forces them to lose Actions or miss drawing extra cards.</p>
