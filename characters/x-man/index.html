  <h1>X Man</h1>
  <p>Nate Grey, the X-Man, was genetically engineered to be the ultimate mutant. In the game, he certainly stands apart. He has a deck of 16 cards (4 more than usual), each of them with a different Special Effect, and during setup he can choose his 3 starting hand cards. His special effects are too numerous to mention them all, but they range from absorbing psionic energy to heal himself or others or shield him from attacks; mental powers that protect him from Crisis tokens or randomizing effects, or can be used to affect other minds, flipping cards in the storyline or making Henchmen attack the Villain; or multiple energy attacks dealing a wide range of damage in close proximity or at range. The downside of all that personal power is that half his cards donâ€™t have action symbols at the bottom, making him a poor team player.</p>
