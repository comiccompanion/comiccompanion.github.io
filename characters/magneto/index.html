  <h1>Magneto</h1>
  <p>Magneto makes for a pretty formidable Hero (when the fancy strikes him). He is a hard hitter who uses his magnetokinesis to deal powerful attacks to many Locations around him, all at once. His intellect is also formidable, allowing him to use any action symbol to perform whatever other action he requires.</p>
<p>As a Villain, Magneto’s Master Plan is to convert any innocent mutants (represented by Civilians in this game) to join his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (turn them into Thugs). Every Villain turn at least 1 Civilian enters the game, but Magneto’s Overflow effects turns all Civilians around it into Thugs. If there are ever no Civilians on any Location, Magneto wins. Besides being persuasive, Magneto is also very powerful. Using organic iron manipulation he primes Heroes to take an inordinate amount of damage. And using his special helmet he is able to not only ignore some damage, but also cancel all Hero special affects for a while.</p>
<p>Besides protecting himself with a magnetic field that makes him impervious to damage, Magneto surrounds himself with powerful Henchmen. Blob holds Heroes in his Location, and attacks both Civilians and Heroes. Mastermind forces Heroes to attack Civilians, revealing a random card from their hand and discarding as many Civilians next to them as the number of Attacks on their card. And then there are the Maximoff twins. Quicksilver runs around and attacks the Hero with the most cards in hand, wherever they may be. And the Scarlet Witch uses her magic to eliminate from the game 1 random card in the hand of a Hero adjacent to Magneto.</p>
