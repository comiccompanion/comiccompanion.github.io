  <h1>Iron Patriot</h1>
  <p>When Norman Osborn took over S.H.I.E.L.D. and assumed the role of Iron Patriot, many were fooled by his propaganda. But forming the Cabal of super villains quickly showed the Heroes they were in for some trouble. Fighting Iron Patriot is really fighting the Cabal, with Iron Patriot as the main Villain and a star-studded roster of “Henchmen” composed of Namor, Doctor Doom, Taskmaster, Emma Frost, and Loki. Each of these bring varied threats to the Heroes, while Iron Patriot flies around positioning Thugs, endangering Civilians, and attacking Heroes with a long-range barrage of armaments. Members of the Cabal may gain Crisis tokens due to Master Plan cards, Overflows, or the various Threat effects. Heroes will need to keep this in check, as they will lose if any member of the Cabal ever accumulates 5 tokens.</p>
<p>Facing such a group of Threats is no easy task. But more than that, this Stretch Goal offers the possibility of placing different members in charge of the Cabal. Each of the Threat cards is double-sided, with the back showing a Villain version of the character. This can be placed on the Villain Dashboard, making Iron Patriot one of the Henchmen and promoting that Henchmen to be the main Villain of the game. Of course, having the game pieces of these characters from the previous Marvel United campaigns will help properly represent them on the board. This means the Cabal can be fought in 6 different ways, depending on which member you choose to act as the main Villain!</p>
