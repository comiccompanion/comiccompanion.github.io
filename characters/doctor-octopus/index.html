  <h1>Doctor Octopus</h1>
  <p>Doctor Octopusâ€™ master plan revolves around nothing short of complete destruction. His actions deploy his terrible Octobots across the Locations, eventually destroying them one by one, until there is nothing left for the Heroes to save!</p>
<p>While his Octobots do their dirty work (which includes attacking heroes), Doc Ock is not afraid to hunt down the Heroes himself, with the aid of his mechanical tentacles. His Threats put Civilians in even more danger, and he also employs a sinister rogues gallery of Henchmen ready to make life very difficult for the Heroes, including Sandman, Vulture, and Mysterio.</p>
<p>Doctor Octopus poses a unique challenge, as Heroes race to clear the Octobots on an ever-shrinking play area, while trying to accomplish their usual Missions.</p>
