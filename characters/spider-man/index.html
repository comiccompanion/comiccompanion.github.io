  <h1>Spider Man</h1>
  <p>Peter Parker is an extremely well-rounded Hero, with plenty of mobility brought by his expertise in web-slinging. With Great Power, Spider-Man can knock out whole gangs of Thugs in an instant, gaining Heroic tokens for that. And with Great Responsibility he can save a bus-full of endangered Civilians and set himself up to strike back at the Villain at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, while we hopefully wouldn’t call it hate, we are very well aware that the reception to the Spider-Man character piece we introduced in the Enter the Spider-Verse expansion was mixed at best. Your reaction made us realize that, indeed, that piece just wasn’t as good as it could be. It wasn’t as good as it should be, especially for such a beloved character. When you’re wrong, you’re wrong, and you do something about it. And what we did was ask our talented sculptors to have an urgent second go at our wallcrawler friend, making him more dynamic and also more grown up, to contrast with Miles Morales. We hope you’ll agree with us that what they came up with is truly worthy of the Amazing title. And so, this will be replacing the original piece in the Enter the Spider-Verse expansion.</p>
