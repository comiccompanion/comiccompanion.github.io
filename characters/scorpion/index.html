  <h1>Scorpion</h1>
  <p>Scorpion’s sting is a deadly one, that Heroes will have to contend with. Whenever he attacks the Heroes, he also gives one of them a Crisis token, representing his venom. Poisoned Heroes are debilitated, being unable to use the Action symbols on the previous Hero card in the Storyline. This facilitates Scorpion’s job of KO’ing the Heroes, giving them KO tokens. One 4 of those have been given out, he wins!</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Scorpion’s first Master Plan card gives him the Scorpion Suit Enhancement, allowing him to perform his BAM twice whenever he BAMs. This card can only be turned facedown, cancelling this deadly effect, when the Clear Threats Mission is complete. Speaking of his Threats, they allow Scorpion to hide behind endangered civilians or criminal networks, being untouchable if there are Civilians or Thugs around him. And be aware that his Overflow is able to bring back cleared Threats!</p>
