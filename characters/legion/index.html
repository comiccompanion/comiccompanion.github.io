  <h1>Legion</h1>
  <p>As a mutant with split personalities, Legion makes for a very unique Hero. Aside from the 2 standard Wild and double Wild cards, each card in his deck is completely unique, representing 10 of his personalities, each bringing their own power to bear. From a ragged adventurer, to a priest, a little girl, an electric entity, and much more, the abilities of Legion’s personas are too numerous to describe. At any time he may be allowing Heroes to freely exchange Action tokens, hurting himself to lay waste to everything around him, cancelling the Villain’s special effects, etc. But beware, Legion’s personalities tend to be quite unstable, and their powers often take a toll on other Heroes, forcing them to discard tokens, play their cards randomly, etc.</p>
<p>The 10 personas Legion manifests as a Hero: Hypnoblocke, Tyrranix, Sally, Susan in Sunshine, Zero G. Priestly, Delphic, Bleeding Image, Cindy, Chain, and Jack Wayne.</p>
<p>Of course, for Legion to be an Anti-Hero, he also requires a set of Villain components, and that’s what the Stretch Goal after that will bring.</p>
<p>As a Villain, Legion is basically 6 Villains in one! His Master Plan deck contains 18 cards (as opposed to the usual 12), 3 for each of his 6 evil personalities. Each one with their own Overflow and Villainous Plot you’ll have to contend with. Facing Legion will certainly be a very different game experience that will take the Heroes out of their comfort zones. In fact, this is the first Villain ever to not have any BAM! at all on his cards.</p>
