  <h1>Kingpin</h1>
  <p>Kingpin’s master plan is all he cares about, and he’ll stop at nothing to accomplish it. His objective involves him reaching every Location in order to establish his dominion. Once he does that, there’s no stopping him. While he may appear to be a mild-mannered businessman, he’ll crush any hero that stands in his way.</p>
<p>The Threats he places in each Location are more of a distraction to the Heroes, something to keep them occupied while his plot unravels. Innocent Civilians may turn into corrupted elite Thugs, his secrets and connections act as a roadblock to completing the Defeat Thugs and Rescue Civilians Missions, and even Bullseye is under his employ, showering the Heroes with attacks.</p>
<p>Facing the Kingpin is a race against time, offering one of the hardest challenges in the game.</p>

<p>Also following backer requests, we have adjusted another art and sculpt to better suit a crime overlord: Kingpin’s suit pocket has been moved to the right side (well, the left side, which is the right side).</p>
