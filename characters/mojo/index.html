  <h1>Mojo</h1>
  <p>Mojo just wants to have the highest-rated TV show in the galaxy, and he will stop at nothing to do it. He will put the X-Men through the ringer in an effort to increase his Ratings track towards victory. He even created and captured mutants to boost his ratings. Now it’s up to the Heroes to rescue them in order to thwart his plan. Fortunately, each rescued mutant is actually able to help in the fight, giving a specific Action to the Hero. And they will need all the help they can get, as the higher his Ratings are, the harder it becomes to damage Mojo.</p>
<p>His Henchman, Major Domo, helps keep Mojo safe, so Heroes can only damage him with Heroic actions. He also finds ways to accelerate Mojo’s master plan, so Heroes should really focus on taking out this insidious helper quickly. On the other hand, Spiral is a very real threat, using her multiple arms and powerful spells to deal damage to several Heroes in multiple Locations. Finally, the bands of Warwolves can make some Locations extremely dangerous to hang around in.</p>
