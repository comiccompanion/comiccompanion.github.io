  <h1>Galactus</h1>
  <p>Hovering above Earth, Galactus stands imposingly in the middle of the play area. Using a Master Plan deck that’s twice the usual size (with 6 random cards removed during setup), Galactus’ focus rotates to target different continents with attacks that not only damage all Heroes there, but also burns through their Action tokens and discards all Thugs and Civilians. Heroes are not really able to damage Galactus with their attacks. Instead, they must run through a gauntlet of 8 randomized Missions, trying to complete them one by one as quickly as possible to stop Galactus before his devastating plan comes to an end. They’ll need to calm down the Civilians, contain riots, steal the Ultimate Nullifier, defeat all four Heralds, and finally convince Galactus to spare Earth!</p>
<p>Acting as Henchmen, each of the four Heralds targets Heroes in different ways, from devastating ranged to attacks to mobilizing Thugs to attack them. Defeating Heralds is not an assurance of safety, however, as Galactus may bring in New Heralds during the game, taking any unused Hero or Villain and conscripting their services to fight the Heroes. Galactus’ remaining Threats may be even more devastating, as they imbue him with enough Cosmic Power to cancel Heroes’ special effects as long as they are in play!</p>
<p>Standing 23 cm tall (9 inches), including his raised base and imposing horns, Galactus stands about 9 cm (3.5 inches) taller than a Sentinel.</p>
