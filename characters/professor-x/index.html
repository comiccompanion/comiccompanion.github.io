  <h1>Professor X</h1>
  <p>Granted, Professor X’s physical condition makes him the least mobile Hero you could find, often relying on his students to get him where he’s needed. But he more than makes up for it with his prodigious mind. His intelligence allows him to use either Heroic or Attack actions as if they were Wild actions. His leadership can grant a couple of Heroic or Attack tokens to any other Hero. With telepathy he may allow another Hero to swap multiple cards between their hand and the Storyline. And he can even fundamentally change the mind of Thugs, turning them into harmless Civilians.</p>
