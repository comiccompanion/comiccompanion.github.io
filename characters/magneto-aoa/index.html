  <h1>Magneto (Aoa)</h1>
  <p>In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Magneto has grown into a true Hero, with a lot more Heroic Actions than his Earth-616 counterpart. His Magnetokinesis has also been honed to focus on devastating attacks against a single Villain. He has also become a respected leader, to the point of sacrificing himself in order to allow his teammates to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Magneto has access to his Helmet in the form of an Equipment card. This offers him permanent protection against effects that would force him to play his cards randomly or facedown, at the cost of turning facedown his earliest played card.</p>
