        <p class="p-2">Ch’od is the muscle of the Starjammers. One of his starting hand cards allows him to add Water tokens to 3 locations. As an amphibious creature, he is in his element in those locations. When fighting there he may also gain Wild tokens and he can even hide away in the water, evading all attacks. Besides a strong body, Ch’od also has a strong mind, gifted with telepathic immunity that shields him from Crisis tokens.... <a href="/characters/chod/">Read more</a></p>

        <p class="p-2">Kamala Khan may look like just a spunky kid, but her powers make her a true Hero, as capable as any other. She can distort her body, turning all action available to her into whatever she needs, or use morphogenetics to bring previously played cards back into her hand. Stretching herself she can even hit enemies in adjacent Locations!

        <p class="p-2">As a Hero, U.S.Agent is a ruthless one. He shows no mercy to Civilians, discarding them in order to perform extra attacks. He will even use Thugs or Civilians as protection, discarding them to avoid damage. Not one to be out upstaged, U.S.Agent can move to the next location with any other Heroes to fight there.
U.S.Agent can use his Shield to either attack an adjacent location or defend his location.... <a href="/characters/u.s.-agent/">Read more</a></p>
