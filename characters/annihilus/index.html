  <h1>Annihilus</h1>
  <p>Annihilus has his plans of conquest and will waste no time executing it to its fullest extent. He starts with a pool of Crisis tokens on his dashboard, depleting it as he KO’s Heroes and causes Overflows. If they run out, annihilation is assured, and the Heroes lose! Annihilus’ onslaught is devastating, attacking several Heroes at once to advance his plan. His Continuous Rebirth Master Plan cards can make the Heroes’ task almost impossible, as each one of them that is played to the Storyline give Annihilus backup Health when he would be defeated.</p>
<p>The Annihilation Wave is bolstered by his Henchmen: Ravenous and the Annihilus Seekers. While Ravenous hunts Heroes over several Locations, the Seekers deal them extra damage if they have cards with Special Effects in the Storyline. To make matters worse, Annihilus’ Master Plan cards can call for reinforcements from the Negative Zone, bringing back cleared Threat cards.</p>
