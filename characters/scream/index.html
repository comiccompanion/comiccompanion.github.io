  <h1>Scream</h1>
  <p>The streets are crawling with symbiotes, and the mentally unstable Scream is out to kill them, believing all symbiotes are evil. The Clear Threats Mission is replaced by Scream’s Eradication Mission. However, this is a Mission the merciful Heroes don’t want to see completed, as they lose the game once its 4 Crisis token slots are filled. To fulfill her Mission, Scream goes around not only attacking Heroes but dealing Crisis tokens to the symbiote “Henchmen”. Whenever one of them accumulates 2 tokens, they discard them and place 1 on the Eradication Mission.</p>
<p>Almost none of Scream’s Threats can be cleared, which means Heroes will get little help from the Locations End of Turn effects. If Scream arrives at a Location with a Psychotic Behavior Threat, she’s able to play another Master Plan card at the end of her turn, though a Hero there can prevent that by discarding a card. Then there’s the army of symbiotes to contend with, all of which attack the Heroes in various ways, some of them dealing unpreventable damage. Venom is the only one of Scream’s Henchmen who can be damaged, once she’s Under Pressure. And Heroes will need to defeat him as Scream cannot be attacked while Venom is in their way.</p>
