  <h1>Shriek</h1>
  <p>Shriek’s influence can be felt far and wide. Using her dark empathy she is able to turn Civilians into Thugs, until there are no innocents left. If there are ever no Civilians in play, the Heroes lose. To try and counter that, Heroes can engage Thugs directly, spending Heroic Actions to turn them back into Civilians. Shriek’s sonic attacks are devastating, damaging all Heroes in her Location and both adjacent ones, and forcing them to run away from her.</p>
<p>Shriek is aided by her dark family of Henchmen: Carnage devours Civilians all around him, Demogoblin flings pumpkin bombs into adjacent Locations, Doppelganger attacks Heroes or Civilians indiscriminately, and Carrion infects Heroes with Crisis tokens, which can continuously hurt them as long as Carrion remains. These Henchmen can be quite a nuisance, as one of her Threats allows them to evade some damage, and one of her Master Plan cards can bring back up to two of them (though that delays her next Villain turn).</p>
