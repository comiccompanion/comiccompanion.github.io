  <h1>Emperor Doom</h1>
  <p>As Earth’s Emperor, Doom reigns supreme, with little concern for the actions of the Heroes. He sits on his throne and sends out his Doombots to consolidate his full control of the world. Working similarly to Thugs, Doombots are added with every Overflow, some Master Plan cards, and whenever a Hero is KO’d. They protect Doom, keeping him from being attacked, and can be upgraded to Advanced Doombots when Emperor Doom adds a Crisis token to them, making them even harder to defeat. But defeated they must be, as the Heroes lose the game if all Doombots are deployed to the game area. While Emperor Doom initially stands aside, only accelerating his plans when he BAMs, once he becomes Under Pressure he starts seeing the Heroes as an actual threat and start personally attacking them and adding Doombots himself.</p>
<p>While Doom’s plan may seem benevolent, ending poverty, crime, hunger, and war, they always benefit his master plan by adding Civilians or turning Thugs into Civilians, then using Civilians to heal himself, or forcing Heroes to forfeit Attack Actions. When the Heroes finally go on the offensive, Emperor Doom always has an escape plan, moving to the opposite side of the game area.</p>
<p>Emperor Doom’s Threats turn Civilians into loyal subjects of Doom, using them to attack the Heroes. And of course, the Doombots may be activated to attack Heroes wherever they are. Namor acts as a powerful Henchman, dealing great damage to Heroes over several Locations around him. Purple Man is key to Doom’s plans, as he is the source for his controlling powers. Purple Man deploys additional Doombots and he cannot be defeated until all 3 Missions have been completed. However, at that point the Heroes can also be victorious against Doom by simply defeating Purple Man!</p>
