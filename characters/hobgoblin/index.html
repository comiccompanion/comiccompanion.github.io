  <h1>Hobgoblin</h1>
  <p>Stealing the Green Goblin’s equipment and improving on his formula, Hobgoblin is ready to unleash his nefarious plans on the Heroes. His arsenal allows him to bombard all heroes in both adjacent locations every time he BAMs, accelerating his plan whenever a Hero is KO’d. Thanks to his improved formula, Hobgoblin is extremely tough. The first time he would be defeated he simply gains 2 Health, plus extra Health for each Threat still in play (and yes, his Overflow effect is able to bring back cleared Threats). His Threats help hinder the Heroes further by depriving them of specific actions and increasing the damage they take.</p>
