  <h1>Silver Surfer</h1>
  <p>The Silver Surfer is not one of the Fantastic Four, and so doesn’t benefit from their unique abilities. Not that this cosmic super-being needs much help. His Cosmic Awareness starting hand card allows him to use 1 Attack or Heroic Action per turn in any Location. His power is always on the rise and he is nearly immortal since he may be able to draw 2 cards instead of 1 at the start of his turns. He’s able to teleport anywhere he wishes, and may even travel dimensionally in order to swap one of the Locations with any other Location not currently in play (everything on the old Location gets moved to the new one).</p>
