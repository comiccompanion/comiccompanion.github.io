  <h1>Ebony Maw</h1>
  <p>Ebony Maw is a very different kind of opponent, using his abilities to cloud the minds of the Heroes. His influence may force Heroes to play their cards randomly, which makes their turns much less efficient and slows down their progress. This is all he needs to gain time and collect all the Infinity Stones he can. Furthermore, his genius intellect sometimes may allow him to play several Masterplan cards in a row.</p>
<p>His Threats allow him to use telekinesis to strike at all adjacent Locations, or to use persuasion to either confuse a Hero or advance his Masterplan. He may even use torture to keep the heroes from helping each other.</p>
<p>Ebony Maw is the most devout Child of Thanos, and it will be a challenge to keep him from handing too many Infinity Stones to his master.</p>
