  <h1>Aurora</h1>
  <p>In the previous campaign we introduced most the Alpha Flight team, but one member was notably missing: Northstarâ€™s twin sister Aurora! This hero is extremely fast, being able to travel at almost the speed of light. If she moves over at least 2 locations during her turn, she is able to perform free Attacks or Heroic Actions. Her speed also makes her very hard to catch, allowing her to evade most negative effects. She may also join with other heroes to power her photokinesis, generating Attack or Heroic tokens. Finally, like all members of Alpha Flight, she can gain extra Action tokens for each Alpha Flight card played on the Storyline.</p>
