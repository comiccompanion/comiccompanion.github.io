  <h1>Queen Veranke</h1>
  <p>Veranke, the Skrull Queen, leads the Secret Invasion, infiltrating all levels of society with her Skrull agents and sowing distrust among the Heroes. Many of her Master Plan cards replace Civilians with Thugs, while others activate her sleeper Thug agents to attack the Heroes. Overflows can also prompt these Thugs to attack Heroes. To make matters worse, Heroes can’t even trust each other, as you never know who may be secretly a Skrull. Many of Veranke’s Master Plan cards force Heroes to reveal the top card of their deck, attacking other Heroes in the same Location if it has an Attack on it!</p>
<p>Two of Veranke’s Threat cards cannot be cleared, further spreading mistrust among Heroes and limiting them to use only 1 Action symbol from the previous Hero card in the Storyline if they start their turn in those Locations. The remaining Threats are Skrull Impostors, masquerading as Heroes. 4 unused Heroes must be used for these Henchmen, drawing cards from their Hero decks in order to defend themselves when attacked or attack Heroes in their Location when Veranke triggers their BAM!</p>
