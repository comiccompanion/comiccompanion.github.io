  <h1>Werewolf by Night</h1>
  <p>Jack does his best to use his feral Werewolf nature for good. His Starting Hand card gives him a regenerative healing factor, allowing him to draw a card every villain turn if heâ€™s taken damage. On the field, he is a true beast, with his lycanthropy strength giving him multiple cards that can perform a Move followed by a double Attack. When he reaches his Bottom of the Deck card, however, a Full Moon shines in the night sky, driving him completely feral, forcing him to play cards randomly and attacking other Heroes if he enters their Location.</p>
